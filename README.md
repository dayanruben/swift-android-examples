# Swift Android Examples

This repository contains sample applications that demonstrate how to use Swift with Android development using the [Swift Android SDK](https://www.swift.org/). Each sample showcases different integration patterns and use cases for Swift on Android.

## Available Samples

- **[hello-swift](hello-swift/)** - basic Swift integration that calls a Swift function.
- **[hello-swift-callback](hello-swift-callback/)** - demonstrates bidirectional communication with Swift timer callbacks updating Android UI.
- **[hello-swift-library](hello-swift-library/)** - shows how to package Swift code as a reusable Android library component.
- **[native-activity](native-activity/)** - complete native Android activity with OpenGL ES rendering written entirely in Swift.
- **[swift-java-hashing-example](swift-java-hashing-example/)** - application that demonstrates how to call Swift code from an Android app with automatically generated Java wrappers and JNI code using [swift-java](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-java).
